## What is MyRead?
MyRead is a new way to blog while you surf. Save webpages to categories of your blog to help the MyRead community find the best currated content on the web. 

## Technologies and Framework
* This is a MERN stack app, ReactJS for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend. 
    * Run this app locally by running **npm install** and then **npm start** in the Client directory and attaching your own mongo database. The backend routes must also be configured to run locally. 
* There is a chrome extension which can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/stoll2882/extension). 
* This app is deployed and cloud hosted on [Heroku](https://my-read-08.herokuapp.com/home).
